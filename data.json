I have been Dropshipping for the past 3years and counting. I\u2019ve created 5 different store that has all did well over 6 figures! The reason my stores are so successful is simply my knowledge of what works and FACEBOOK ADS! I\u2019ve spent over 10k on a mentor years ago to learn the ends and outs of the Facebook platform. I strongly believe I can make any store profitable! If you\u2019re serious about having a business to show for that brings in income for you every single day then this store is for you. This store comes with over 200 high converting products that will kill it for you this summer! Also well written high converting descriptions to get the customers to pull the trigger! My reason for selling this store is because I had created two stores at the same exact time thinking I can manage both.. A Women\u2019s Fashion Store and a Men\u2019s Fashion store. I decided to run ads to the Men\u2019s store first to test and it completely was a winner I\u2019ve already crossed 100k in sales and will provide a screenshot below to show you.

Our Warehouse in Midlands UK receives the stock as inventory is tracked aswell, which he then sends it packaged accordingly with our branded logo and giving it a special treat, then it arrives to our customer. The shipping is quiet fast max 15 days internationally as service used is Royal Mail or DHL according to customer choice.\nThere is still around 500 branded packaging with our manufacturer in Hong Kong which he can ship out items once you buy the store. They will indeed package as we agreed with them just before we moved to the warehouse in the UK. The only drawback to that is long waiting times of up to 20 days for delivery.

Such type of posting is good, however we would still recommend contacting influencers to advertise products which they don't require any monetary value but more of a product to them for free which is usually a better return on investment. as if it's not successfully then you end up with well taken pictures with our packaging and jewelry."],["What is your cost of customer acquisition?\nFB Advertising customer acquisition average in $20 but this can go as low as $11\/purshase with a non limited advertising strategy. forgot to add Our FB advertising spending is usually fixed to $13'000 per month and this is due to the volumes of orders we are able to process and communications we are able to respond to.

Included in the sale will be all the products currently listed on the site and about $7,000 worth of inventory. The idea behind our business was to make a curation of really great products that are developed by other small businesses(creators). So many of our products are made and fulfilled(dropshipped) by the creator. We then pay them the order value less our commission which typically ranges from 20%-50%. All of these relationships will transfer to the new owner. We also work with a couple manufacturers that we buy product in small batches from, sell and ship ourselves. These contacts will also be transferred."],["One of the greatest benefits of buying this business with this model is when you want to add new products you will be able to find products you love and then reach out to those new vendors through Etsy, Instagram, Pintrest or wherever you find them., and offer them the oportunity to have their products sold on Sugarhouse Supply. When vendors see the website, branding, and instagram following it will give you instant credibility and it is a very high chance that they will want to work with you. It is so great to be able to sell high quality products without having to hold all the inventory. And so much better than using Oberlo or dropshipping poorly made overseas product! We also have a great connection in San Diego to sell awesome made in LA mid century furniture that we have not had a chance to set up with yet. This contact would also be included."],["Lastly, the most lucrative portion of the business is our artwork. We use [REDACTED] and have a partnership with Framebridge who fulfills these orders for us. It is extremely streamlined. We spend no more than 5 hours a week on this business. It is very automated and easy to run. Which will allow you to have plenty of time to spend on growing it."],["It is such a fun business and it is great to work and support all these other small businesses, which customers also love and appreciate and love to buy from.

Squishies are truly the ideal mail order product. They have an indefinite shelf life, can't be damaged in the mail and weigh just a few ounces!\nThe company launched on Black Friday of 2016 after learning about the trend through our young daughter. I noticed a demand for an honest and reliable US-based squishy shop, and the idea was validated with an instant stream of traffic.\nThe popularity of slow rising squishies has since skyrocketed. Google Trends has tracked a 242% increase for this query in the last 18 months. Despite this explosion, it remains difficult to find reliable distributors and it takes time to gain access to the high-demand premium brands. My suppliers have been thoroughly vetted, are responsive and prompt. I receive early updates of upcoming releases and enjoy discounts as a frequent buyer because of these strong relationships.\n[PRIVATE INFO] visitors break down into three basic groups:\n1) Children and teens, mostly girls, in the U.S.\n2) Adults buying gifts for children and teens\n3) Wholesale customers buying in bulk (brick and mortar retailers in the U.S. and Canada)\nOrganic traffic from Google searches and returning customers make up the lion's share of the visitors (averaging more than 17,000\/month). Social media accounts are established, Instagram and YouTube being the most active. Note that sales increased 174% during the months of November and December.\nThe current model is to drop ship wholesale orders but to ship retail orders from inventory stocked at my location in the US. It would however be easy to return to a drop ship only model. Existing inventory has a retail value of about $9,500 including about 100 unique products with live listings. This inventory is included in the sale of the business and will be shipped to the new owner.\nI recently had a baby and, while it is an ideal business to run from home, it is hard for me to grow the company as a new mom. The website generates great traffic as is and requires only minor maintenance. The squishy trend continues to grow, and there are many new avenues to explore. With our loyal customer base and dependable suppliers [PRIVATE INFO] is a solid and proven enterprise with a promising future."],["Check your email periodically and Private seller should get back to you shortly.

Price slightly negotiable.\nI started this store on November 20 because a friend of mine had an instagram page in this niche with around 800k followers. After a lot of research I discovered that there is a huge passionate market for this specific niche with low competition and a big variety of products. Our initial plan was to market the store on his instagram page and scale it later with facebook ads with lookalike audiences. Unfortunately my partner sold his instagram page and I don't want to continue with this store because it's not really my type of niche, so I want to sell it to someone that will put in the time and work to make huge profits from this. I only did marketing on my partner's instagram page so you can imagine what you can do with e-mail marketing,facebook marketing, instagram influencers etc. There's a lot of potential in this. We only got into jewelry products, bedding sets and a little of home decoration. You can also jump into clothing products, home decoration, statues, crystals, gemstones and a lot of other things. All the products are sourced from Aliexpress with the Oberlo app. The store is operating on a dropshipping model. The amount of hours I put in this was around 1 or 2 hours a day. Since we didn't had to pay for marketing, the profit margins we're around 80%. The highest earnings we had we're on Black Friday-Cyber Monday with $2300 in 3-4 days with only 10 posts on his page. The store has an professional design for smooth and easy customer experience, fast loading times, professional logo and beautiful proven to sell existing products. We only marketed the store for like 3 months and a half, since he sold his page. The sales made after that we're from returning customers because we offered an amazing customer service and experience.\nThe store is highly brandable and has everything you need for you to begin your e-commerce adventure. \nAlso, if you want I can include a course that I bought for $1000 that contains everything you need to know about Facebook Marketing ( I learned everything I know about facebook marketing from it) - Ben Malol Social Marketing Masterclass - the best on the market. \n If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask."],["Check your email periodically and Purcaru A. should get back to you shortly.
